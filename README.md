# springboot-webmvc-project

## Features
List and briefly describe the key features and functionalities of your project. For example:
- Web MVC for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- Spring Cloud Gateway for API gateway functionality.
- Input validation and error handling for better user experience.
- Secure endpoints using Spring Security.
- JWT authentication for user authorization.

## Security
# Security
In this project, we've implemented basic Spring Security to ensure a secure and controlled access to your application. Here's a breakdown of the key security components:

# CORS Policy Checking:
We have configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to control which origins are allowed to access resources on your server. This helps prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.

# CSRF Protection:
We have enabled CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection to mitigate potential attacks. This ensures that all state-changing requests, such as form submissions, are accompanied by valid CSRF tokens.

# Role-Based Security: 
We have implemented role-based security to restrict access to certain endpoints or functionalities based on user roles. Roles help determine what actions users are allowed to perform within the application. For example, you can have roles like "USER" and "ADMIN."

## Exception Handling
To enhance the error handling and provide clear error messages for both developers and front-end clients, we have implemented custom exceptions. Custom exceptions make it easier to pinpoint the source of errors and communicate meaningful messages. Here's how we handle exceptions:

We've created a set of custom exception classes that extend standard Java exceptions like RuntimeException. These custom exceptions capture specific error scenarios and provide human-readable error messages.

When an exception is thrown within the application, we catch it and then throw a custom exception with a relevant error message. This allows us to provide detailed information about what went wrong.

The front-end can consume these error messages to improve the user experience by presenting informative error messages to users. Developers can also use these messages for debugging and issue resolution.

## JWT Authentication
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure authentication in this project. Here's how the JWT authentication process works and how you can obtain and use tokens:

# Obtaining JWT Tokens:

When a user logs in or authenticates, a JWT token is issued by the server.
This token contains information about the user and is signed with a secret key to ensure its integrity.
Using JWT Tokens for Secure Access:

For subsequent requests, the client (e.g., a web or mobile application) includes the JWT token in the request headers.
The server verifies the token's signature and extracts user information.
Based on the user's information and roles, the server determines whether the request is authorized and responds accordingly.
Session Time Validation:

JWT tokens have an expiration time. When a token expires, the user must re-authenticate.
This provides security by ensuring that even if a token is somehow compromised, it has a limited lifetime.
By using JWT tokens, we achieve stateless authentication, making it scalable and suitable for distributed environments. The tokens securely encapsulate user identity and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access the application's protected resources.
